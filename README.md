## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many individuals lack access to clear, trustworthy, and culturally relevant information about basic financial tools and practices.  
This gap in financial literacy leads to difficulties in:
- Using digital payment methods like UPI

These challenges are amplified for non-English speakers and people unfamiliar with financial jargon or technology.
